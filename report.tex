\section{Project Description}

My project is about solving for existential variables in one or more
equations, such that the equations become satisfied after semantic
reductions have occurred. This ends up being a restricted form of a
semantic unification problem that has several universally quantified
variables and a single existential variable. The left hand-side of the
equation is always the existential variable applied to some number of
arbitrary expressions, and the right-hand side is an arbitrary
expression. A futher restriction is that the aforementioned arbitrary
expressions cannot include the existential variable.

Notably, the a solution for an existential variable can be a
higher-order term -- a function that takes other functions as
arguments. I use genetic programming, mostly replicating the work by
Matthias Fuchs in his ``Evolving Combinators'' paper, to solve for the
existential variables. The interesting part of this kind of GP is that
higher-order solutions can be evolved. In standard GP with lambda
terms, a crossover could result in variables unintentionally capturing
other variables, or referencing variables not currently in scope. In
Fuchs' GP, the population of candidate solutions are higher-order
combinators. Trees of applications of combinators implicitly
manipulate variables (via point-free programming), but crossover is
not problematic because variables are never explicitly bound or
referenced.

\subsection{Combinatory Logic Problems}

Most of my time was spent using the project to solve combinatory logic
problems. For example, the following combinatory logic problem asks for a term
consisting exclusively of combinators that is equivalent to the
desired lambda-expression.

$$
T = \lambda a,b . ~ b ~ a
$$

A solution to this problem is the combinator below.

$$
(S(K(S((SK)K))))K
$$

In my system, this problem is represented by the following equation.

$$
\forall a,b . ~ \exists T . ~ T ~ a ~ b = b ~ a
$$

Besides functions, I was also interested in evolving problems
containing datatypes. Notably, problems with datatypes can be
considered a subset of combinatory logic problems by using church
encodings. For example, below if the church-encoding of true and
false.

\begin{align*}
\n{true} &= \lambda a. \lambda b. a\\
\n{false} &= \lambda a. \lambda b. b
\end{align*}

Using Church-encodings, you can represent the ``and'' problem as
follows.

$$
\forall a,b . ~ \exists \n{and} . ~ \n{and} ~ a ~ b = a ~ b ~ a
$$

My algorithm has to give solutions in terms of some primitive set of
combinators. I started with just S and K, which are sound and complete
for the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic. However, after
experimentation I ended up discovering that S, K, I, B, and C are a
good base set. The combinators B and C can be seen as common/useful
specializations of S, and are due to the logician Moses Sch{\"o}nfinkel.

\begin{align*}
S &= \lambda a,b,c . ~ a ~ c ~ (b ~ c)\\
K &= \lambda a,b . ~ a\\
I &= \lambda a . ~ a\\
B &= \lambda a,b,c . ~ a ~ (b ~ c)\\
C &= \lambda a,b,c . ~ a ~ c ~ b
\end{align*}

The GP system is based on term-rewriting, so the axioms above are
actually encoded as follows.

\begin{align*}
S ~ a ~ b ~ c &= a ~ c ~ (b ~ c)\\
K ~ a ~ b &= a\\
I ~ a &= a\\
B ~ a ~ b ~ c &= a ~ (b ~ c)\\
C ~ a ~ b ~ c &= a ~ c ~ b
\end{align*}


\subsection{Hilbert System Problems}

Besides Church-encoded problems, I also wanted to solve problems with
native datatypes (to avoid the inneficiencies associated with
encodings, and to be more similar to real languages).
To do so, I ended up using a Hilbert system. A Hilbert system replaces
the standard implication introduction and elimination rules with the
combinators S and K, and axiomatically extends the system with other
native types. For example, below is the Hilbert system for a language
with booleans.

\begin{align*}
S ~ a ~ b ~ c &= a ~ c ~ (b ~ c)\\
K ~ a ~ b &= a\\
\n{If} ~ \n{true} ~ a ~ b &= a\\
\n{If} ~ \n{false} ~ a ~ b &= b
\end{align*}

Now, my system can encode the ``and'' problem using native datatypes of a
Hilbert system as follows.

\begin{align*}
\forall a,b . ~ \exists \n{and} .\\
\n{and} ~ \n{true} ~ \n{true} &= \n{true}\\
&\land\\
\n{and} ~ \n{false} ~ b &= \n{false}\\
&\land\\
\n{and} ~ a ~ \n{false} &= \n{false}
\end{align*}

The problem above demonstrates two extensions of my system, where we
can give multiple fitness cases (multiple equations), and we can apply
arbitrary expressions (e.g. ``true'' instead of just variables) to the
desired existential on the left-hand side.

\section{Code Appendix}


%% Last week I started testing GP evolving solutions to problems
%% involving datatypes, but they were Church-encoded datatypes (i.e. they
%% were represented using lambdas). This week I started to move the
%% project towards being able to evolve solutions using primitive
%% datatypes and operations over them. One way to extend combinatory
%% logic to have extra primitives ends up beign Illative Combinatory
%% Logic, which I thought I was going to use originally. However, there
%% are tricky issues regarding logical consistency in the illative
%% version, so what I ended up using was more like a Hilbert system
%% (regular combinators like S+K and axioms, rather than strange
%% combinators like $\Xi$ that can lead to inconsistency).

%% In previous weeks I have tested evolving combinatory logic problems
%% with S+K, S+K+I, S+K+B+C, and S+K+I+B+C. My project had the logic for
%% combinator use hardcoded, so any such change required me to edit old
%% code and recompile things. This week I changed my architecture so the
%% base combinators, and their reduction semantics, is independent
%% of the rest of the code (so I don't have to touch or recompile old
%% code when testing a new axiomatic basis).

%% I have also allowed problems to be supplied with multiple fitness
%% cases, instead of just one. Additionally, the fitness cases are now
%% parameterized over arbitrary terms instead of just variables.

%% All of this work together has allowed me to specify a combinator set
%% for boolean problems like the one below:

%% \begin{verbatim}
%% S x y z = x z (y z)
%% K x y = x
%% If True ct cf = ct
%% If False ct cf = cf
%% \end{verbatim}

%% And I can now specify problems with multiple fitness cases and
%% non-variable arguments like the one below for logical ``and''.

%% \begin{verbatim}
%% and True True = True
%% and True False = False
%% and False True = False
%% and False False = False
%% \end{verbatim}

%% Now I need to test many such problems to see how well the Genetic
%% Hilbert system is able to solve them.
